Blockchain Node
For deploying an application in production, you need a server. A blockchain node does this job for blockchains. 
Blockchain nodes are network stakeholders or devices running the “blockchain software”. 
Hence, they are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger, serving as communication hubs for the network tasks.
 A P2P (Peer to Peer) protocol allows nodes to communicate within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.

You can self-run blockchain nodes or get a Node service provider like 
1)  Quicknode 
2)  Moralis
3)  Infura etc.,
 that offer APIs to create automated flows. For self-hosting, AWS Cloud and Azure have images for you to spin up for the more popular chains.
 Otherwise, most chains make it easy for you to run your nodes/validators.
 The only thing that can be a hassle is to ensure uptime and maintenance, which depends on your network.
