Many developers might not know, but the frontend technologies for Web3 and Web2 are the same. 
The only difference is where you need to reimagine the UX of the application because the authentication,
 processing in the blockchain, and general flow of the application are slightly different from Web2 applications.

I would recommend going on with React & Next.js since most developers are currently using this in the Web3 world.
 I might be biased, but almost every other project presently features a React integration.
 If you’re using Webpack 5, make sure that there are certain polyfills you need to take care of while developing an application;
 the rest of everything is generally the same.

For the client-side backend, things get a bit different.
 Here is where you need to understand how to interact with the blockchain you’ve created.
 Web3 Interaction libraries help you with that, but you need to know how they work and interact with the blockchain properly.
