P2P Database
The first question that anybody would ask here is: 
Why do we need a database when we’re using blockchain in the first place?
 Additionally, will it not hinder our idea of a dApp?

As a simple answer to that, storing data on a blockchain is slow and expensive.
 We need an additional database to access data off-chain, ensuring that we’re 
not accessing the chain again and again. To have that decentralization part of it,
 we use peer-to-peer or P2P databases that store and host all of the data in streams
 to eliminate centralized database servers, blockchains,
 or local storage. Think about how your torrents get downloaded!

The !!!!Ceramic network!!!! is the most common decentralized database provider out there, as I know of personally.
