Decentralized File Storage


Like every other application, we need a dedicated file storage system (similar to Amazon S3 for Web2 applications).
 Databases essentially are tabular data, while file storage is that folder-based data you need to store your large media files.
 IPFS is the most common P2P file system protocol with excellent community support.
 Arweave is another option focused on keeping data permanently.
 You can use platforms like Filecoin, Skynet, Storj, and 0Chain to host these file storage systems.
